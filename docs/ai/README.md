## How to use

- **Verify** the files are tracked: `git ls-files "docs/ai/"` and
  `git ls-files "ai-provenance.json" "AI_DISCLOSURE.md"`.
- **Validate** the JSON: `python -m json.tool ai-provenance.json`.
- **Confirm** provenance pathways are not ignored:
  `git check-ignore -v AI_DISCLOSURE.md ai-provenance.json docs/ai/ 2>&1`.
- **Add a new entry** (IDs must end with `AI-Assisted: yes` in the body,
  per `.gitmessage`).

## Redaction policy

All files in this directory must not contain real credentials, tokens,
internal hostnames, email addresses, or private URLs. Where such data
appeared in a conversation, replace it with clearly-marked placeholders
(`***REDACTED***`).
